Hello~ ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Python Developer, a Machine Learning Solutions Architect, and a Data Scientist.

I use GitHub mainly for working on personal projects, and writing down notes/code snippets.
Most of the time, I'm working on [TIL: Today I Learned](https://github.com/harplife/TIL).

I'm all about improving lifestyle, like how to take notes efficiently.
Do yourself a favor and look up __ZettelKasten__, and check out my [ZettelKasten](https://github.com/harplife/zettelkasten).
But of course, the best thing to do would be to try it yourself!

You may not find what you look for here ðŸ¤”
but I do hope that what you see here will help you in some way!
